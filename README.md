# MonMon-Redux

It's the return of the MonMon

## Long Long plans
  
### Stage 1

- Make MonMon a PWA
- Save Redux state in local storage
- Map this local storage to some sort of graph database?
- Write tests!
- Have a play with Python + Neo4j
- Try using Python type annotation
- Write Python tests!
- Be SOLID!
- Okta for Auth
- Plaid for account querying

### Stage 2

- Theoretically, there is good test seed data for Neo4j
- Theoretically, the Python API is solid + auth'd
- Therefore, write a Flutter App
- Also therefore, also write a React-Native App
- Also therefore, write an Electron app with Typescript
